namespace chi {
/// The result object, used for identifiying errors with good diagnostics
///
/// ## Usage:
/// If you want to construct a default result object, just call the default constructor:
/// \snippet ResultExample.cpp Constructing
///
/// `res` is the most common name for an error object, prefer it to other names.
///
/// When constructed, results are successful by default:
/// \snippet ResultExample.cpp bValid
///
/// When an error, warning, or just some event that requries logging needs to be added to the result
/// object,
/// call `Result::addEntry`:
/// \snippet ResultExample.cpp AddWEntry
///
/// note the `W` at the beginning of the error code, this is important. If it's an `W`, it's
/// considered an warning and the result will still be considered successful:
/// \snippet ResultExample.cpp bValid2
///
/// If that leading character to the error code is an 'E', then it's considered an error
/// \snippet ResultExample.cpp AddEEntry
///
/// And the result is not successful anymore:
/// \snippet ResultExample.cpp Check
///
/// If you're calling another operation that emits a Result object, then there's an easy to
/// integrate that result object: the opeartor+=
/// \snippet ResultExample.cpp Append
///
/// ## Standardized names in data:
/// In order to have good parsing of errors, some standards are good.
/// If you are trying to represent this data in your error, use these
/// standards so it can be parsed later on and presented to the user in a nice way
///
/// Name in JSON  | Description
/// ------------- | -------------
/// `Node ID`     | The ID of the node that errored
///
/// # What is EUKN?
/// Not every error in chigraph is documented and tested. Errors with numbers are tested and
/// possibly documented.
/// EUKN errors are just undocumented errors.
///
/// ## Implementation Details:
/// Result objects store a json object that represents the error metadata.
/// It's an array, each being an object containing three objects:
/// - `errorcode`: The errorcode. This is an identifier representng the error: a
///    character followed by a number. The value of the character changes the behaviour:
///      - `E`: it's an error and sets `success` to false.
///      - `W`: it's a warning
///      - `I`: it's just info
///
///   If it's anything else, that it will cause an assertion
/// - `overview`: A simple string representing the generics of the problem. It *shouldn't* differ
/// from
///   error to error, if you need to include specifics use the `data` element
/// - `data`: Extra metadata for the error, including context and how the error occured.
